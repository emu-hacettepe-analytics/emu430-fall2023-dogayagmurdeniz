I'm honored to be a member of the "Team Safe Istanbul" project team.

**Summary**

Our objective is to compile a comprehensive report and identify the districts in Istanbul that are most susceptible to potential earthquakes. We aim to create an ordered priority list for neighborhoods and develop a risk map for Istanbul, taking geographical coordinates into account.
